# What is this?

This is the source code for the Ruby on Rails app which powers stevegrossi.com. Its duties include managing my portfolio (referred to as "works"), books I've read ("books" by "authors"), posts I've written, which can be optionally be about a book or an external link, plus a handful of informational pages and redirects.
