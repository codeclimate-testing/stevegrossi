    <h2>Time with You</h2>
    <p>More than stuff, what would make me happy is some quality time with you. You could take me out for dinner or out to something culturalâ€”something we'd both enjoy. The older I get, the more I realize that people are the only thing that really matters.</p>

    <h2>Helping a Worthy Cause</h2>
    <p>Honestly, I've got everything I need and then quite a bit more. I'm lucky to have a great, loving family and all my animal needs and comforts satisfied, but there are plenty of people out there who've not been so lucky. Here are three charities that do a lot of good. I support them all personally, and would be honored if you'd do so as well.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Children's International</h3>
        <p>Provides assistance with food, education, healthcare, and mentorship to impoverished and disadvantaged children around the world.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>charity:water</h3>
        <p>Digs wells in communities that lack access to fresh, clean water. Their operating costs are covered by a benefactor, so 100% of all donations go directly toward helping people.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Kiva</h3>
        <p>Lets you lend money to people around the world trying lift themselves out of poverty. You get kept up-to-date about how your money is used, and when your loan is repaid (as 99% of loans are), you can keep the money or lend again.</p>
