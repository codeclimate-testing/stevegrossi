  <p>I make and run websites for Cancer<i>Care</i>, an awesome nonprofit in New York City which provides free services like counseling, information, and financial aid for people affected by cancer. (If you or a loved one is impacted by a cancer diagnosis and need somewhere to turn for help, call 1-800-813-HOPE.) While my job has me doing everything from Ruby on Rails development to Photoshop, I specialize in front-end user interface design. In other words, I design web pages and parts of pages to facilitate the goals of Cancer<i>Care</i>’s visitors and the organization itself. If you’d like, you can view a sample of <a href="/work">the work I do</a>.</p>

  <p>That’s me when I’m wearing slacks and shiny shoes. Off the clock, I read books about the things I find interesting, especially philosophy, design, media studies, and what it means to be human—that last topic is best covered through fiction—and I write to make sense of the things I learn. I also enjoy craft beer and keeping a tank of aquatic friends happy.</p>
